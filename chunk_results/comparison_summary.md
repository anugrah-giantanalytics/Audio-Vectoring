## Comparison Summary

| Method | Precision | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Whisper** | High for text-based understanding | - Accurately captures semantic content<br>- Provides readable text output<br>- Good at understanding speech content | - Depends on transcription quality<br>- Loses audio characteristics<br>- Requires OpenAI API key |
| **Wav2Vec** | Excellent for exact audio matching | - Precise audio feature matching<br>- Works well for non-speech audio<br>- No external API dependency | - No semantic understanding<br>- Less robust to audio variations |
| **CLAP** | Moderate for multimodal search | - Supports both text and audio queries<br>- Some semantic understanding<br>- Balances audio and semantic features | - Less precise than specialized methods<br>- Slower processing<br>- Results may be unexpected |

## Conclusion
Each method has distinct advantages for different use cases:

- **Whisper**: Best for semantic understanding and text-based search of speech content
- **Wav2Vec**: Excellent for exact audio matching, sound effects, and non-speech audio
- **CLAP**: Most versatile with support for both text-to-audio and audio-to-audio search, at the cost of some precision

The ideal approach depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the audio content being processed.
